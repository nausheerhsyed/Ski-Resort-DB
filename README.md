## **Information Needs:** 

- The key to providing an exceptional experience for both visitors and resort operators lies in meeting their specific information needs. This section highlights the critical data requirements for improving operational efficiency and guest satisfaction at the Summit at Snoqualmie Ski Resort. 

- 1.) Guest Information and ticketing hinges on the seamless operation of services. Access to up-to-date and detailed guest profiles, ticket sales, and season pass data empowers the resort to streamline check-in processes and anticipate visitor preferences.

- 2.) Employee Management covers various roles - from ski patrollers to kitchen staff and hotel management. Maintaining a skilled and professional workforce that caters to guest needs ensures the resort's smooth operation.

- 3.) Skiers and Snowboarders - the availability of trail data and slope conditions allows them to plan for their visit. Important information, including trail names, difficulty levels, lengths, and elevations, guides visitors in selecting trails and planning their day based on individual skill levels. Guest satisfaction is maximized by providing accurate insights into lift operational status, maintenance schedules, lift capacity, and wait times.

- 4.) Before guests hit the trails, a well-organized parking system ensures a hassle-free start to the day. Data on parking lot capacity and availability helps guests save time to enjoy the slopes.

- 5.) The safety and enjoyment of guests depend on slope quality. Furthermore, real-time snow information guides grooming, safety, and trail choices.

- 6.) Finally, keeping track of resort events, activities, and schedules is important for guest satisfaction. Data on event dates, registrations, and participant details ensures smooth resort operations.
